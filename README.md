# UWB-Based Tunnel Vehicle Over-Speed Detection System

> A low-cost, high-precision speed monitoring system using UWB DS-TWR and Kalman Filter for tunnel environments.

---

## 📌 Introduction

Conventional speed enforcement systems in tunnels rely on ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) cameras, which are costly and vulnerable to environmental conditions.

This project proposes an alternative system using **UWB (Ultra-Wideband)** with **DS-TWR (Double-Sided Two-Way Ranging)** to calculate a vehicle's average speed in a tunnel and detect over-speed in real-time.

## ⚙️ System Overview

- **UWB Module**: Decawave DWM1000
- **Tunnel Length**: 5 meters
- **Placement**:
  - Anchors: entrance & exit of tunnel
  - Tag: attached to front of vehicle
- **Over-speed Threshold**: 1.5 m/s

### Speed Calculation Formula:


Where:
- T1 = Timestamp at tunnel entry
- T2 = Timestamp at tunnel exit

## 🧠 Key Methods

### 🛰️ DS-TWR (Double-Sided Two-Way Ranging)

- Measures round-trip time (ToF) for accurate distance
- Corrects propagation delay and calculates position

### 🔧 Kalman Filter

- Reduces noise in UWB distance measurements
- Combines prediction and observation in real time
